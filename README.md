# GPUComputing-Homework2

## Compile the code
First make sure that `nvcc` is available to use as a compiler. To compile to code simply type `make` in the home directory.

## Run the code
The compiled program is stored in the `/bin` folder. It takes as a required argument the size of the matrix, expressed as a power of two (e.g. ./bin/GPU_CompH2 4 will create a matrix of size 16X16).
